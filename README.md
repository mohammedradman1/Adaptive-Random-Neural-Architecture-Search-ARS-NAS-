# Adaptive-Random-Neural-Architecture-Search-ARS-NAS-
Adaptive Random Neural Architecture Search (ARS-NAS) is a novel approach for efficiently exploring deep neural network architectures. It adapts sampling probabilities based on previous trial performance, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation to achieve competitive accuracy with reduced search cost.
